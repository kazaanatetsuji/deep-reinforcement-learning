# Project 2: Continuous Control.

### Introduction

For this project, you will work with the [Reacher](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#reacher) environment.Reachers has an enviroment with a sigle agent and an 20 agents. In this work, a single versions is used.

In this environment, a double-jointed arm can move to target locations. A reward of +0.1 is provided for each step that the agent's hand is in the goal location. Thus, the goal of your agent is to maintain its position at the target location for as many time steps as possible.

The observation space consists of 33 variables corresponding to position, rotation, velocity, and angular velocities of the arm. Each action is a vector with four numbers, corresponding to torque applicable to two joints. Every entry in the action vector should be a number between -1 and 1.

### Solving the Environment

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment,  your agent must get an average score of +30 over 100 consecutive episodes.

### Getting Started

1. Download the environment from one of the links below.  You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:

    - **_Version 1: One (1) Agent_**
        - Linux: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/one_agent/Reacher_Linux.zip)
        - Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/one_agent/Reacher.app.zip)
        - Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/one_agent/Reacher_Windows_x86.zip)
        - Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/one_agent/Reacher_Windows_x86_64.zip)
    
    (_For Windows users_) Check out [this link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/827218/how-to-determine-whether-a-computer-is-running-a-32-bit-version-or-64) if you need help with determining if your computer is running a 32-bit version or 64-bit version of the Windows operating system.

    (_For AWS_) If you'd like to train the agent on AWS (and have not [enabled a virtual screen](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md)), then please use [this link](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/one_agent/Reacher_Linux_NoVis.zip) (version 1) or [this link](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/Reacher_Linux_NoVis.zip) (version 2) to obtain the "headless" version of the environment.  You will **not** be able to watch the agent without enabling a virtual screen, but you will be able to train the agent.  (_To watch the agent, you should follow the instructions to [enable a virtual screen](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md), and then download the environment for the **Linux** operating system above._)

2. Place the file in the DRLND GitHub repository, in the `p2_continuous-control/` folder, and unzip (or decompress) the file. 

### Dependencies

To set up your python environment to run the code in this repository, follow the instructions below.

1. Create (and activate) a new environment with Python 3.6.

	- __Linux__ or __Mac__: 
	```bash
	conda create --name drlnd python=3.6
	source activate drlnd
	```
	- __Windows__: 
	```bash
	conda create --name drlnd python=3.6 
	activate drlnd
	```
	
2. Follow the instructions in [this repository](https://github.com/openai/gym) to perform a minimal install of OpenAI gym.  
	- Next, install the **classic control** environment group by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/openai/gym#classic-control).
	- Then, install the **box2d** environment group by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/openai/gym#box2d).
	
3. Clone the repository (if you haven't already!), and navigate to the `python/` folder.  Then, install several dependencies.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning.git
cd deep-reinforcement-learning/python
pip install .
```

4. Create an [IPython kernel](http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/kernel_install.html) for the `drlnd` environment.  
```bash
python -m ipykernel install --user --name drlnd --display-name "drlnd"
```

5. Before running code in a notebook, change the kernel to match the `drlnd` environment by using the drop-down `Kernel` menu.

### Instructions

Follow the instructions in Continuous_Control.ipynb to get started with training my agent.

Start the environment of Unity downloaded according to the OS.
Check the number of states and the number of actions of "Reacher" and create an Agent.
Train the agent and save the learning results as a file(checkpoint.pth).
Check the operation of the agent based on the above results.
